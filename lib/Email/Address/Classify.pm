Email::Address::Classify - Classify email addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Email::Address::Classify;

    $email = Email::Address::Classify->new('a.johnson@example.com');

    print "Is valid:  " . $email->is_valid() ? "Y\n" : "N\n";    # Y
    print "Is random: " . $email->is_random() ? "Y\n" : "N\n";   # N

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple way to classify email addresses. At the moment, it only
provides two classifications is_valid() and is_random(). More classifications may be
added in the future.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new($address)

Creates a new Email::Address::Classify object. The only argument is the email address.

=item is_valid()

Performs a simple check to determine if the address is formatted properly.
Note that this method does not check if the domain exists or if the mailbox is valid.
Nor is it a complete RFC 2822 validator. For that, you should use a module such as
L<Email::Address>.

If this method returns false, all other methods will return false as well.

=item is_random()

Returns true if the localpart is likely to be randomly generated, false otherwise.
Note that randomness is subjective and depends on the user's locale and other factors.
This method uses a list of common trigrams to determine if the localpart is random. The trigrams
were generated from a corpus of 30,000 email messages, mostly in English. The accuracy of this
method is about 95% for English email addresses.

If you would like to generate your own list of trigrams, you can use the included
C<ngrams.pl> script in the C<tools> directory of the source repository.

=head1 TODO

Ideas for future classification methods:

    is_freemail()
    is_disposable()
    is_role_based()
    is_bounce()
    is_verp()
    is_srs()
    is_batv()
